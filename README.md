# SmartTape - London Studios
**SmartTape** is a **FiveM** police tape resource allowing you to secure scenes with different tapes, which we believe is a first for FiveM. You can easily add tape in an area, move tape and set the length all from a simple menu. We've included a police tape model with three variants, a british police tape, inner corden tape and fire tape. You have the ability to customise these textures and change the name for the menu.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!

 2.  Add the contents of **"resource"** inside it. This includes:
"Client.net.dll", "fxmanifest.lua", "config.ini", "SharpConfig.dll", "NativeUI.dll", "stream"
3. In **server.cfg**, "ensure" SmartTape, to make it load with your server startup.
## Configuration
The "config.ini" file allows you to change the names of the tape that they appear in, for the menu. This may allow you to change the tape textures, for example if you wanted to change the fire tape to a police tape.

    Tape1 = Police Tape
    Tape2 = Inner Cordon Tape
    Tape3 = Fire Tape

On **line 2**, you can change the name of the first tape.
On **line 3**, you can change the name of the second tape.
On **line 4**, you can change the name of the third tape.

You are not able to add more tapes at this time, we may add this in the near future!

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to SmartTape and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!

## Errors & Suggestions
If you encounter any bugs or errors with the plugin, we encourage you to report them and we will actively fix them. We are also looking for suggestions on how we can improve this, ensuring all users get the best possible experience.

Please note there are no physics currently with the tapes and they do not move in the wind, we may look into this for the future - stay tuned for more updates!

## Credits
We could not have made this plugin without the help of a third party modeller. We'd like to thank Adam Fenton for creating the 3D model, and L.Walker for texturing the police tape! We hope to work with them in the future.

## Screenshots
We've really enjoyed making this plugin. Take a look at some screenshots of the plugin in action.
